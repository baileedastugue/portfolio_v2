      <Typography paragraph className={classes.paragraph}>
        As a full stack software engineer, I engage the same part of my brain
        that loves organic chemistry and the part that needs text to be
        vertically and horizontally centered. While I gravitate towards the
        front end, I'm willing, able, and excited to tackle the full stack. My
        positive attitude is a constant - I start every scrum with a "good
        morning", no matter how many blockers I have to report that day. My
        attention to detail, my ability to communicate cross functionally from
        designer to developer, and my focus on business priorities makes me an
        asset to any team.
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph className={classes.paragraph}>
        In my free time, I'm watching Star Trek with my husband, teaching myself
        how to knit (again!), and listening to an absurd amount of Billy Joel.
